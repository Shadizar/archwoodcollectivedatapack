NOTE:  This is for 1.19.2 and 1.20.1; see my other repos for newer versions, and note that I split them to Biomes O Plenty and Ars Nouveau (The Ars one contains also the mage name pack)

* Adds a name pack (if you are a Minecolonies patreon member of the appropriate tier) for minecolonies, for mage-like names

* For all players, enables the colonists to craft necessary Ars Nouveau items,

* Enables selected blocks in the architect cutter

* Adds some BoP and Ars blocks as pathblocks

* Permits forester to strip archwood and Biomes O Plenty logs

* Added Biomes O Plenty flowers to the list of items the florist can grow

That way, when playing our Archwood Collective style, your colonists are intrinsically aware of the relevant items and can craft most, upon being taught.

In your particular save (on the server if playing server, in the local client otherwise) place the zip (or unzip to folders) as with any standard datapack, in the Datapacks folder.

Requires Minecolonies and dependencies, Ars Nouveau, and Biomes O Plenty
