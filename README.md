# archwoodcollectivedatapack
Minecolonies related datapack to partner with stylepack Archwood Collective (an Ars Noveau-centric pack)
Main focus on keeping data current is at https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/data-pack-in-support-of-our-minecolonies-style-archwood-collective/

* Adds a name pack (if you are a Minecolonies patreon member of the appropriate tier) for minecolonies, for mage-like names

* For all players, enables the colonists to craft necessary Ars Nouveau items,

* Enables selected blocks in the architect cutter

* Adds some BoP and Ars blocks as pathblocks

* Permits forester to strip archwood and Biomes O Plenty logs

That way, when playing our Archwood Collective style, your colonists are intrinsically aware of the relevant items and can craft most, upon being taught.

In your particular save (on the server if playing server, in the local client otherwise) place the zip (or unzip to folders) as with any standard datapack, in the Datapacks folder.

The style itself is at www.planetminecraft.com/project/archwood-collective-interim-dist/


Requires Minecolonies and dependencies, Ars Nouveau, and Biomes O Plenty
